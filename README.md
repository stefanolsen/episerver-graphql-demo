# Demonstrating a GraphQL API in Episerver Commerce

## Overview
This repository contains the class files demonstrating how to add a GraphQL API to an Episerver Commerce webshop. The code is implemented based on Episerver's Quicksilver sample site.
The code is explained in [this blog post](https://stefanolsen.com/posts/using-graphql-with-episerver-commerce/).

## Installation
To try out the demonstration code:

- Copy the files into a working [Episerver Quicksilver sample site](https://github.com/episerver/Quicksilver) solution.
- Include those files in the Visual Studio project.
- Add the NuGet package, GraphQL.
- Then build and run.

To test queries you will need a GraphQL query tool, like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). Then run a query from one of the Gists from [this collection](https://gist.github.com/stefanolsen/d4232756606643765a0ca1b7de3dbcb5).
